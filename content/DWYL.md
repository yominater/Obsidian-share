## My Search for a Single Passion to Live By
When we inevitably reach the end of our lives. Will we look back and think of all the time we wasted? Of all the useless activities?

We want to 'not waste our lives' but sometimes we fall in a trap of, not asking "What more can I do?" but "What is permissible?"

## Breakthrough—The Beauty of Christ, My Joy

### Johnathan Edwards
Johnathan Edwards was a pastor and theologian in New England. He had a passion for the supremacy of God. He wrote some resolutions in his early twenties to intensify his life for the glory of God:

- Resolution #5: "Resolved, never to lose one moment of time; but improve it the most profitable way I possible can."
- Resolution #6: "Resolved, to live with all my might, while I do live"
- Resolution #17: "Resolved, that I will live so, as I shall wish I had done when I come to die."
- Resolution #22: "Resolved, to endeavor to obtain for myself as such happiness, in the other world, as I possible can, with all the power, might, vigor, and vehemence, yea violence, I am capable of, or can bring myself to exert, in any way that can be though of"

#22 is in reference to Edwards having violence against his sin, as such in Matthew 5:29. Also he was talking about being happy in God as a way to glorify him.

> [!bible] [Matthew 5:29 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/5/)
> 29. If your right eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell.

> [!QUOTE] Johnathan Edwards in "Nothing Upon Earth Can Represent the Glories of Heaven"
> \[The] glory of God \[does not] consist merely in the creature’s perceiving his perfections: for the creature may perceive the power and wisdom of God, and yet take no delight in it, but abhor it. Those creatures that so do, don’t glorify God. Nor doth the glory of God consist especially in speaking of his perfections: for words avail not any otherwise than as they express the sentiment of the mind. This glory of God, therefore, \[consists] in the creature’s admiring and rejoicing \[and] exulting in the manifestation of his beauty and excellency. . . . The essence of glorifying . . . God consists, therefore, in the creature’s rejoicing in God’s manifestations of his beauty, which is the joy and happiness we speak of. So we see it comes to this at last: that the end of the creation is that God may communicate happiness to the creature; for if God created the world that he may be glorified in the creature, he created it that they might rejoice in his glory: for we have shown that they are the same.

The Bible is clear: God created us for his glory.

> [!bible] [Isaiah 43:6-7 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/23/43/)
> 6. I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’<br/>and to the south, ‘Do not hold them back.’<br/>Bring my sons from afar<br/>and my daughters from the ends of the earth—
> 7. everyone who is called by my name,<br/>whom I created for my glory,<br/>whom I formed and made.”

> [!QUOTE]+ John Piper
> God created me—and you—to live with a single, all-embracing, all-transforming passion, namely, a passion to glorify God by enjoying and displaying his supreme excellence in all the spheres of life. ... The wasted life is the life without a passion for the supremacy of God in all things for the joy of all peoples.

Enjoying and displaying are both crucial. If we don't,  we display a shell of hypocrisy and create scorn or legalism in display without enjoyment. Vice versa, we deceive ourselves because the mark of joy is to share it with others.

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 10:31 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/46/10/)
> 31. So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

**What does it mean to glorify God?** ^b28b44
It does not mean similar to 'beauty', but something else. It means more similar to the word 'magnify'. We are to make him more look more like the greatness and beauty with infinite worth that he actually is. We are to raise what others see of him to his actual attributes. 

We were made to see and savor God; to be completely satisfied in him. We are to spread this; in doing so we share love. 

The really wonderful moments of life are not self-satisfaction but self-forgetfulness. In nature we see things that take focus away from us and point to God. 

> [!bible]+ [Psalm 19:1 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/19/19/)
> 1. Psalm 19<br/>For the director of music. A psalm of David.<br/>The heavens declare the glory of God;<br/>the skies proclaim the work of his hands.

God made the universe big and us small to say something about himself, that is is great and powerful and wise and beautiful. It is for us to learn that he is infinitely great, powerful, wise, and beautiful. 

> [!QUOTE]+ John Piper
> What makes the good dead an act of love is not the raw act, but the passion and the sacrifice to make God Himself known as glorious. ... If you don't point people to God for everlasting joy, you don't love. You waste your life.

Eternal life is knowing God and his son. We were made to stand in awe of a person, the only one worthy of awe. Nothing else can satisfy the soul.
God loves us by liberating us from the bondage of self so that we can enjoy knowing and admiring Him forever. God calls us to do this to make much of Him in all we do, in every part of our lives.
*All of this must be done through Christ* This is the only way it will last.

God sent Jesus to give us this eternal and best pleasure. Jesus came down to us, and made himself nothing. He became like the form of a servant. He humbled Himself, even to death to receive our sins. This is the only way it could happen.

<u>If we are not following God, we will regret it one day</u>

## Boasting Only in the Cross, the Blazing Center of the Glory of God
**We should not boast in anything except one thing. The cross.**
If we desire that there be no boasting except in the cross, then we must live near the cross-indeed we must live on the cross.

> [!bible]+ [Galatians 6:14 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/48/6/)
> 14. May I never boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.

We only boast *in* the cross when we are *on* the cross. We are dead to the world, and the world is dead to us. Because we have been crucified.

> [!bible]+ [Galatians 2:20 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/48/2/)
> 1. I have been crucified with Christ and I no longer live, but Christ lives in me. The life I live in the body, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.

We have been crucified. When Christ died, all that are and will be His died also. When we become His we(our old self) die. When we become His, our new self is [[born again]].

> What does that mean practically? Does the new self just mean that we have a want to do better more?

#### Practicably?
We can still be glad for physical things like safety and security. "Being dead to the world does not mean not having no feelings about the world. It means that every legitimate pleasure in the world becomes a blood-bought evidence of Christ's love, and an occasion of boasting in the cross.

When God gives us blessings, yes they are nice to us physically, but we are meant to see who they are coming from. They are pointing us to Him. It is better to give these gifts away to others rather than hoard them to ourselves. It shows the personality of God more.
#### Suffering

> [!bible]+ [2 Timothy 3:12 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/55/3/)
> 12. In fact, everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,

> [!bible]+ [2 Corinthians 12:9-10 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/47/12/)
> 9. But he said to me, “My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest on me.
> 10. That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

God is sovereign over Satan. God decides where Satan goes to glorify Him and for the good of his people.

It's not wrong to run away from suffering. Sometimes it's God's plan for us to have an escape. The point though is to not run for being a slave to fear.

There is risk in everything we do, even more so for Christ. Like how the Israelites were scared of the land of Canon and did not go in and attack leading to God punishing them for 40 years, it's not good to do the same.

Although all this is good, we should not get caught up in self-denial which disables us from enjoying the pleasures of this life that God gave us, or risk for the sake of self-exaltation. *Everything in moderation, including moderation*. The point of the risk is to glorify God, not ourselves.

God takes things away, yes, but he gives us the things to do us will and be supremely happy in Him. To trust Him and do His will. God gives us everything we need to do things we wants us to do.

No suffering will take us away from God's love.

#### The Goal of Life - Gladly Making Others Glad in God
Risking your life to make others glad. It's impossible to make others glad in God if you don't forgive people. You can't only see their flaws and mistakes.

> [!DEFINITION]- Glad
> Pleased, happy, gratified.

The motivation for being a forgiven person is God. He forgave us our sins so we are able to know and enjoy Him forever. Therefore the root motivation for forgiving is "...the joy of being freely and joyfully at home with God." We receive an impulse for forgiving people in the joy that God forgave us. WE should experience forgiveness as a free and undeserved joy in God to carry us through the World.

The nature and aim of glad-hearted Christian giving is the effort to give others joy in God. As our purpose is to glorify God by being satisfied in him, we live to gladly make others glad in God. We glorify God in the pursuit of their gladness.

### Living to Prove He is More than Life
We need to show that Jesus is more than life. That he is worth more than anything else in this world, under the sun. We do this by not putting him over things in this world, like stuff. We shouldn't be focused on obtaining and securing *things*.

## We Are Living in a time of War
Although we don't always think it, we are living in a war between God and sin. In a war we make sacrifices to further our cause. Are these things important in a war? Our values change a lot if we believe it.

There is time for relaxation though. The point is to don't waste our lives.

In war, we make sacrifices for the greater good. Too often we get comfortable living every day like there is peace.
In war, we ask, "What can I do to help?" "What can I do to bring victory?" "What can I sacrifice to advance the cause?"
In peacetime, we ask, "What can I do to be more comfortable? " This is the wrong response. We should be asking questions like, "How will this help me treasure Christ more?" or "How will this help me know or display Christ?"

### Losing Our Lives

> [!bible] [Mark 8:35 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/41/8/)
> 35. For whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for me and for the gospel will save it.

We waste our lives when we lose our lives by trying to save them.

> What does 'saving them' mean?
Use our possessions to show that Christ is our Treasure thusly keeping us on the path to heaven?

Some people think we can lead a good life by avoiding sin, hard work during the week, and fun on the weekend(church). This is a wasted life. We are designed for much more. On the death bed, will you ever think, "I wish I spent more time at the office".  

Money becomes useless for lasting happiness. Relationships become precious.

Time with the family means more than TV and video games. Point - Don't simply avoid evil things. Search for things that are good.

#### TV

^b3ba8c

TV is bad for us because the content is so shallow and trivial the "capacity of the mind to think worthy thoughts withers and the capacity of the heart to feel deep emotions shrivels."

> [!QUOTE] Neil Postman
> What is happening in America is that television is transforming all serious public business into junk. . . . Television disdains exposition, which is serious, sequential, rational, and complex. It offers instead a mode of discourse in which everything is accessible, simplistic, concrete, and above all, entertaining. As a result, America is the world’s first culture in jeopardy of amusing itself to death.

Because of things like TV, God has gained a sort of "weightlessness" even in the church. We don't have as much concern for his authority.

> [!QUOTE]+ Douglas Groothuis
> The triumph of the televised image over the word contributes to the depthlessness of postmodern sensibilities. . . . One cannot muse over a television program the way one ponders a character in William Shakespeare or C. S. Lewis, or a Blaise Pascal parable, or a line from a T. S. Eliot poem, such as ‘But our lot crawls between dry ribs / to keep its metaphysics warm.’ No one on television could utter such a line seriously. It would be “bad television”—too abstract, too poetic, too deep, just not entertaining. . . . [Not only that] but the images appear and disappear and reappear without a proper rational context. An attempt at a sobering news story about slavery in the Sudan is followed by a lively advertisement for Disneyland, followed by an appeal to purchase panty hose that will make any woman irresistible, etc., ad nauseum.

> [!bible] [Matthew 5:47 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/5/)
> 47. And if you greet only your brothers, what are you doing more than others? Do not even pagans do that?

## Making Much of Christ from 8 to 5
While becoming a missionary or a job such as those is a way to not waste your life, the war is being fought everywhere, not just physically.

God calls us to be spread out, to be the salt of the earth. We are supposed to get different jobs around and work hard.

You can contribute anywhere. "You don't waste your life by *where* you work, but by *how* and *why*"
There are separate 'church' and 'secular' callings, but they are both beneficial. They are no different from a spiritual view. They are all doe for the bodily and spiritual welfare of the community as we all serve each other.

Some people are meant to stay behind and supply, to give. God calls us to different jobs as he requires of us. We shouldn't assume we need to join a 'spiritual' job.

### Working Hard

> [!bible] [2 Thessalonians 3:7-11 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/53/3/)
> 7. For you yourselves know how you ought to follow our example. We were not idle when we were with you,
> 8. nor did we eat anyone’s food without paying for it. On the contrary, we worked night and day, laboring and toiling so that we would not be a burden to any of you.
> 9. We did this, not because we do not have the right to such help, but in order to make ourselves a model for you to follow.
> 10. For even when we were with you, we gave you this rule: “If a man will not work, he shall not eat.”
> 11. We hear that some among you are idle. They are not busy; they are busybodies.

> [!SUMMARY] Main idea
> People should not be lazy. They should work hard.

[[DWYL#^work|What should we work for?]]
### How Can We Make much of God in the way We Work?
#### 1. Through the Fellowship that We Enjoy with Him through the Day in All Our Work
Christians don't just 'go to work', they go to work *with God*

Be thankful you can work at all. Be thankful for everything that God gave you. Be thankful for every minute of life. Praise him and trust him and lean on him. Have a relationship with God.

> [!SUMMARY] Main idea
> Work *with* God

#### 2. We Make much of Christ in Our Secular Work by the Joyful, Trusting, God-exalting Design of Our Creativity and Industry
We glorify God in more than our hard work. We are glorify got differently than animals.

> [!bible] [Genesis 1:27-28 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/1/)
> 27. So God created man in his own image,<br/>in the image of God he created him;<br/>male and female he created them.
> 28. God blessed them and said to them, “Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground.”

God creates us to *subdue* the earth and *rule* over it. In other words, we should be busy understanding, shaping, designing, and using God's creation in a way that calls attention to his worth and wakens worship. So, we should reflect what God is really like, not by making ourselves look great, but to make him look great. We should be working excellently to show God's glory. When you do this you can have a sweet sense of peace at the end of the day. **Work is not a curse. It is still a good, God-like thing.**

The second way to make much of God in secular work is the joyful, trusting, God-exhaling design of our creativity and industry. God made us for work so that when we consciously rely on his power and shape the world after his excellence, we might be satisfied in him, and he would be glorified in us.

Each hour of work becomes a boast in the cross when we remember this joy is only possible for undeserving sinners.

> [!SUMMARY] Main idea
> Work hard to shape the earth to end up glorifying Christ

#### 3. We Make much of Christ in Our Secular Work when it Confirms and Enhances the Portrait of Christ's Glory that People Hear in the Spoken Gospel
Our work *adorns* the doctrine of God. The way we do it increases or decreases the attractiveness of the gospel we profess before unbelievers.

If we work and live well, obstacles will be removed.

> [!bible] [Colossians 3:23 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/51/3/)
> 23. Whatever you do, work at it with all your heart, as working for the Lord, not for men,

Make much of God by having high standards of excellence and integrity and manifest good will. Then there will be no obstacles of the gospel.

> [!SUMMARY] Main idea
> Work hard and well to glorify Christ

#### 4. We Make much of Christ in Our Secular Work by Earning Enough Money to Keep Us from Depending on Others, while Focusing on the Helpfulness of Our Work rather than Financial Rewards
God created us to work satisfyingly to provide for our needs.

At creation, we were created to work without futility and frustration. God made man to work the ground, from the ground. Work was not the sustainer, God was. Adam was a son working with his Father in the stewardship of creation. Man was free *in* work to be creative without stress. When sin came into the world, work became hard with the futility and frustration of the fallen creation.

Christ *did* redeem us from the curse of the law, but toil and death are still things which we experience. We still need to work for our needs. 

> [!BIBLE]- ##### Bible Verse References
> > [!bible] [Matthew 6:25, 32-33 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/6/)
> > 25. Do Not Worry<br/>“Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat or drink; or about your body, what you will wear. Is not life more important than food, and the body more important than clothes? ...
> > 32. For the pagans run after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them.
> > 33. But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well.
> 
> > [!bible] [Matthew 11:28 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/11/)
> > 28. “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest.
> 
> > [!bible] [1 Corinthians 15:58 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/46/15/)
> > 58. Therefore, my dear brothers, stand firm. Let nothing move you. Always give yourselves fully to the work of the Lord, because you know that your labor in the Lord is not in vain.

In summary, God does not want his children to be burdened with the futility and frustration of the weariness depression of toil. He wants to free us from that section of the curse too. 

We should make much of Christ by working like him, and not being lazy. We should follow his will for the design of the age. 

We are called to earn our own living to meet our needs, however, financial profit should not be our focus. ^work
There is no point to labor for the 'food that perishes', or wealth here on earth. We should instead focus on how helpful our product or service can become. 

> [!bible] [John 6:27 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/43/6/)
> 27. Do not work for food that spoils, but for food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you. On him God the Father has placed his seal of approval.”

God has removed the anxious toil with trust in God's promise to supply our own needs. The call is to seek the kingdom of God first and the food that perishes will be given to us. 

> [!bible] [Philippians 4:19 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/50/4/)
> 19. And my God will meet all your needs according to his glorious riches in Christ Jesus.

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 7:30-31 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/46/7/)
> 30. those who mourn, as if they did not; those who are happy, as if they were not; those who buy something, as if it were not theirs to keep;
> 31. those who use the things of the world, as if not engrossed in them. For this world in its present form is passing away.

We should buy things, yes, but acting as if we have no goods. We can do business, but stay free from it. The financial dealings is not our life. 

If something were to happen to our income, we are not to worry about our food. Our peace and love are not all gone. The above still applies. We should still enjoy Christ's being exhaled in the way we work. Jesus calls us to be aliens and exiles in this world. 

#### 5. We make much of Christ in our secular work by earning money with the desire to use our money to make others glad in God
We should dream how to use our excess money to make others glad in God. 
The point is that secular work can be a God honoring blessing by giving our earning we don't need to meet the needs of others. We should help people who need it. 

> [!bible] [Acts 20:35 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/44/20/)
> 35. In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”

#### 6. We make much of Christ in our secular work by treating the web of relationships it creates as a gift of God to be loved by sharing the gospel and by practical deeds of help

Personal evangelism is important. One of God's jobs for us is to evangelism. 

The first church was a group of people walking around sharing the gospel. It was on their lips around new relationships. They freely received; they freely gave. They were moved by the words of Jesus:

> [!bible] [Mark 8:36-37 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/41/8/)
> 36. What good is it for a man to gain the whole world, yet forfeit his soul?
> 37. Or what can a man give in exchange for his soul?

The point isn't that we should quit work and become a full-time evangelist. The point is that work has it's proper meaning and significance. 

For many, the move toward missions and deeds of mercy will not be a move away from one's work, but with one's work. Not only should we ask what our vocation is, we should ask how it should be lived out. 

> [!INFO] Conclusion
> Secular work is not a waste when we make much of Christ in it. 
> God's aim is to be known, as knowing him is life and joy. He does not remove the need to work, destroying society and culture. He spreads a passion for his supremacy. 
> Work like the world and waste your life, or work for the glory of Christ and your satisfaction will last forever and God will be exalted in your joy. 

### The Majesty of Christ in Missions and Mercy: A Plea to This Generation
Missionaries and ministers of mercy don't come from nowhere, they come from people like us. If you a passion for have pity for perishing people and the reputation of Christ, you must care about world missions.
