The Builder - The Blueprints - Like Arrows

**Psalm 127:** Part of book 5. Psalm 107 points to a new exodus. 127 is meant to be sung as the jews return to Jerusalem from exile; Babylon. 

## The Builder
The house in this passage mean more to liniage than brick and mortar houses. 
> [!bible]+ [Psalm 127:1-2 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/19/127/)
> 1. Psalm 127<br/>A song of ascents. Of Solomon.<br/>Unless the Lord builds the house,<br/>its builders labor in vain.<br/>Unless the Lord watches over the city,<br/>the watchmen stand guard in vain.
> 2. In vain you rise early<br/>and stay up late,<br/>toiling for food to eat—<br/>for he grants sleep to those he loves.


If the Lord is not with us, we toil uselessly. It is all anxious toil. It is vanity. We fill hours, we pass time, but nothing gets done. 
**How do I know what I'm doing matters?**

## The Blueprints
(for raising children)
> [!bible]+ [Psalm 127:3 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/19/127/)
> 3. Sons are a heritage from the Lord,<br/>children a reward from him.

Children are something to build with. 
What is the blueprint? How do we make sure we are on the right path?
We can look at the s'hma in Deuteronomy 6:4 


We can't just go to church and think that replaces God's blueprint. It can't stand up to it. It doesn't have the power. 
"If we never have headaches when they are little, then we shall have plenty of heartaches when they are older" - Spurgeon

## Like Arrows
> [!bible]+ [Psalm 127:3-5 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/19/127/)
> 3. Sons are a heritage from the Lord,<br/>children a reward from him.
> 4. Like arrows in the hands of a warrior<br/>are sons born in one’s youth.
> 5. Blessed is the man<br/>whose quiver is full of them.<br/>They will not be put to shame<br/>when they contend with their enemies in the gate.


Psalm 127 connects with Genesis reminding us about punishment of man. 

Children are for warfare. -> Christ is the promised offspring. He defeated Satan. The battle still continues though. Raising children well contributes in the war that goes back all the way to the garden. The children are like arrows. 

God gave us a blueprint to prepare children for hardships. 

When funeral, what will be shown? Will I have wasted my life? Will my legacy only be that I was a good person? That I liked a good joke? Or will I have followed the blueprint? [DWYL](../../DWYL.md) Will I say I have lived a good life? I have finished the race?
