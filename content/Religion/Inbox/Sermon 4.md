We need to repent from sin, not just regret sin. Regretting sin won't fix the issue. We need to talk to God.

### Points
God alone is worthy of worship. The redemption of humans is worthy of worship. God alone is worthy of worship, therefore God mist act. 

Redeeming humans is not a small process. The start of a new creation. Christ is the first fruits of that creation. 

Man's transgression is against God so only he can forgive it. 

God is the only secure place to put faith. God repeatedly brings salvation throughout the Bible. 

The Old Testament demands it
> [!bible]+ [Isaiah 9:6 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/23/9/)
> 6. For to us a child is born,<br/>to us a son is given,<br/>and the government will be on his shoulders.<br/>And he will be called<br/>Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God,<br/>Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace.

"The only one who can bring God's kingdom into reality is God himself" - Wellam

No one else would become the redeemer. God loves us in only God can. Angels could not make the sacrifice. 

"Did not the Lord hang the world on nothing but His word, and can we not hang our souls there too"
