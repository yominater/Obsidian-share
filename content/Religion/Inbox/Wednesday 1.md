# Hell
God hates people who sin. He doesn't simply hate sin. 

The Devil doesn't dispense wrath. Good dispenses wrath in hell. In hell; God is still there and is present while wrath is dispensed. 

There are multiple motivations to Christianity like heaven and hell, but they are not equal. 

> Am I beginning to hate sin I used to love, and love righteousness I used to hate? 

The grace of God rather than heaven should be our motivation for Christianity. 

The ransom of Christ was payed to God's justice. Jesus died because something had to die.
