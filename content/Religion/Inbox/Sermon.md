Standing firm in the true grace of God. 
It's the footing that makes it hard to stand firm. **What you stand on matters** It's not about what tries to push you over or move you. 
In life, we will feel overwhelmed by the waves. No matter how strong we are, the waves will eventually come. They always will come. We can't stand the waves alone. 

Each command has two parts
**Exhortation** - do this
**Declaration** - already done

4 major waves that we are going to face that will threaten us to give up the faith. 

**1. Identity**
Who you are. We are strangers in the world since we were born again. 

The world will try to make us forget/reject our identity in Christ. 
The world will try to sort us, and if we are not secure we will get moved. 

**2. Conformity**
Who we surround ourselves with. Good people can turn bad with outside influence, by surrounding yourself with bad people. 

We need to surround ourselves with good Christian people, with the people you want to be. 

 **3. Suffering**
Do not be surprised about challenges. Be ready for it. We will either get drowned by the wave or get driven to Jesus. 
With suffering, we need to be prepared by already being strong in God. We need to go straight to God. 

**Sin/satan**
We are called to be Holy. We are called to be different than the World. The process of this is [Sanctification](../Topics/Sanctification.md). Sin is not following God. It's going to be hard for us not to be tempted for us. It'll get harder when we leave home. 
We are going to fail eventually. The devil takes his chance and will attack us. Accusations, lies, and slander. He tells us lies. When we believe the devil, we want to run away from God. We need to respond not that way.

These are big waves. Thank goodness we have the footing of the Gospel. 

When the waves come, know who you are and hold on tight. We are born to a better family, don't forget it. 

We need to set a better pattern for the people who come after us. 

For us, be a part of the 1/3 who stay in the church, and in the faith. 

Settle now who God is, and how h loves us so much. Do this before suffering. Look to him who conquered satan. 

With our feet on the solid rock, not only *will* we not be moved, we *cannot* be moved. Stand firm in the true grace of God.
