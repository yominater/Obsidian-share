[Humans](Topics/Humans.md) are created by [God](Topics/What%20is%20God.md) to [Glorify God](Topics/Glorify%20God.md) and enjoy Him forever [^1] and also to complete the Great Commission. 

[Humans](Topics/Humans.md) were created to be with [God](Topics/What%20is%20God.md) in paradise but then [the Fall](the%20Fall) happened and now we have to live with [sin](Topics/What%20is%20sin.md). We have lived with sin since. God required animal sacrifices until [](Topics/What%20is%20God.md#Jesus|Jesus) came to Earth and became the ultimate sacrifice. God gave us [grace](Topics/Grace.md) by sacrificing his only son to save our sins. Now Jesus lives lives inside of us with the [](Topics/What%20is%20God.md#Holy%20Spirit|Holy%20Spirit) helping us. 

We must use [faith](Topics/Faith.md) to believe in Him; to believe that he died for our sins and was raised again. If we want to be proficient at this, we should follow Jesus as he [describes](Topics/How%20to%20follow%20Jesus.md). 

We need to live our daily lives [focused on God](Topics/How%20to%20think%20about%20God.md). We need to steer away from things the [](Topics/Humans.md#The%20flesh|flesh) tells us to do. We should be focused on [glorifying him](Topics/Glorify%20God.md) in all that we do. We should also focus on evangelism and spreading the word of the Gospel message to the lost. Slowly through [Sanctification](Topics/Sanctification.md) are we transformed to be more like Jesus, to adjust our wills to God's will.  [Humans need not worry](Topics/Humans%20need%20not%20worry.md) since God has everything under control. He is in control of everything and he will do as he sees fit. 

There are forces, however, working against God and us, trying to get us to stray away from God. [The devil](Topics/What%20is%20the%20devil.md) tries to pull us away with his demons and his will. He wants us in [Hell](Topics/Hell.md) away from God.
