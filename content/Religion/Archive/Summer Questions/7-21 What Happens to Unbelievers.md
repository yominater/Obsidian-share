# What Happens to Those Who Have Never Heard the Gospel?
> [!bible] [Romans 1:16-32 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/1/)
> 16. I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is the power of God for the salvation of everyone who believes: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile.
> 17. For in the gospel a righteousness from God is revealed, a righteousness that is by faith from first to last, just as it is written: “The righteous will live by faith.”
> 18. God’s Wrath Against Mankind<br/>The wrath of God is being revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of men who suppress the truth by their wickedness,
> 19. since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them.
> 20. For since the creation of the world God’s invisible qualities—his eternal power and divine nature—have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.
> 21. For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him, but their thinking became futile and their foolish hearts were darkened.
> 22. Although they claimed to be wise, they became fools
> 23. and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images made to look like mortal man and birds and animals and reptiles.
> 24. Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
> 25. They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshiped and served created things rather than the Creator—who is forever praised. Amen.
> 26. Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts. Even their women exchanged natural relations for unnatural ones.
> 27. In the same way the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.
> 28. Furthermore, since they did not think it worthwhile to retain the knowledge of God, he gave them over to a depraved mind, to do what ought not to be done.
> 29. They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit and malice. They are gossips,
> 30. slanderers, God-haters, insolent, arrogant and boastful; they invent ways of doing evil; they disobey their parents;
> 31. they are senseless, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
> 32. Although they know God’s righteous decree that those who do such things deserve death, they not only continue to do these very things but also approve of those who practice them.

The Bible can answer tough questions, we just need to look in. This question though might be the hardest question though.

Paul does not be ashamed of the Gospel. 

> [!bible] [Romans 10:9-10 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/10/)
> 9. That if you confess with your mouth, “Jesus is Lord,” and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
> 10. For it is with your heart that you believe and are justified, and it is with your mouth that you confess and are saved.

> [!bible] [Romans 10:17 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/10/)
> 17. Consequently, faith comes from hearing the message, and the message is heard through the word of Christ.

God makes Himself known to us, and he makes us known through creation. 
Everybody should know these things:
1. God exists
2. God has eternal power
3. God has a divine nature
Therefore men should be without excuse. 

But sin takes over and "Professing to be wise they became fools". They created idols and did not worship God. The sin inside of them disrupted the image of God. Sin always takes over the unreached. 

Then God gave them over to their desires. He let them go and they sinned and sinned. 

##### How is this fair? 
People say:
**1. Universalism**
Says that every person who has ever lived or will love will go to heaven. Heaven is open to all people. 
> [!bible] [Romans 2:7 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/2/)
> 7. To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, he will give eternal life.
The Issue

**2. Pluralism**
Every religious person will go to heaven. 'It's not fair to work hard in a religion and not go to heaven' 

**3. Inclusivism**
Every religious person will die and go to heaven. They're just christians and don't realize it. 

*All of these are heresy*

**4. Exclusivism**
You must put your faith in Jesus to die and go to heaven. Everyone is a sinner. 
> [!bible] [John 14:6 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/43/14/)
> 6. Jesus answered, “I am the way and the truth and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.

> [!bible] [Romans 10:14 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/10/)
> 14. How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?

It is fair because it is what we deserve.

> Do I want to be the one to cause the rocks to cry out?
