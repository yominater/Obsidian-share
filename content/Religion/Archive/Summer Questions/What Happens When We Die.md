# What Happens after We Die?
The nature of human life is the bringing together of Body and Spirit.

What happens after we die(As Christians)?
**Things to know**
1. Death is an enemy.
2. Death us the payment for sin.
3. Death happens when the body's processes stop.
4. Death is *not* the end. 
Dead is dead, but dead is still existent. 

Death is the separation of body and spirit and where we still exist. 

When we die theologians say we are in an intermediate state, or 'Heaven'.
