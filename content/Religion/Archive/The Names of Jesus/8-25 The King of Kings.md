## The King of Kings
He sent us something very personal. He left the throne of heaven and gave Himself. He wants a personal relationship with us.

> [!bible]- [Isaiah 52:13-15 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/23/52/)
> 13. The Suffering and Glory of the Servant<br/>See, my servant will act wisely;<br/>he will be raised and lifted up and highly exalted.
> 14. Just as there were many who were appalled at him—<br/>his appearance was so disfigured beyond that of any man<br/>and his form marred beyond human likeness—
> 15. so will he sprinkle many nations,<br/>and kings will shut their mouths because of him.<br/>For what they were not told, they will see,<br/>and what they have not heard, they will understand.

> [!bible]- [Isaiah 53:1-12 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/23/53/)
> 1. Who has believed our message<br/>and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed?
> 2. He grew up before him like a tender shoot,<br/>and like a root out of dry ground.<br/>He had no beauty or majesty to attract us to him,<br/>nothing in his appearance that we should desire him.
> 3. He was despised and rejected by men,<br/>a man of sorrows, and familiar with suffering.<br/>Like one from whom men hide their faces<br/>he was despised, and we esteemed him not.
> 4. Surely he took up our infirmities<br/>and carried our sorrows,<br/>yet we considered him stricken by God,<br/>smitten by him, and afflicted.
> 5. But he was pierced for our transgressions,<br/>he was crushed for our iniquities;<br/>the punishment that brought us peace was upon him,<br/>and by his wounds we are healed.
> 6. We all, like sheep, have gone astray,<br/>each of us has turned to his own way;<br/>and the Lord has laid on him<br/>the iniquity of us all.
> 7. He was oppressed and afflicted,<br/>yet he did not open his mouth;<br/>he was led like a lamb to the slaughter,<br/>and as a sheep before her shearers is silent,<br/>so he did not open his mouth.
> 8. By oppression and judgment he was taken away.<br/>And who can speak of his descendants?<br/>For he was cut off from the land of the living;<br/>for the transgression of my people he was stricken.
> 9. He was assigned a grave with the wicked,<br/>and with the rich in his death,<br/>though he had done no violence,<br/>nor was any deceit in his mouth.
> 10. Yet it was the Lord’s will to crush him and cause him to suffer,<br/>and though the Lord makes his life a guilt offering,<br/>he will see his offspring and prolong his days,<br/>and the will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.
> 11. After the suffering of his soul,<br/>he will see the light of life and be satisfied;<br/>by his knowledge my righteous servant will justify many,<br/>and he will bear their iniquities.
> 12. Therefore I will give him a portion among the great,<br/>and he will divide the spoils with the strong,<br/>because he poured out his life unto death,<br/>and was numbered with the transgressors.<br/>For he bore the sin of many,<br/>and made intercession for the transgressors.

Sometimes we simply don't want to listen or know hard things; suffering.

> [!bible]- [1 Peter 1:10-12 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/60/1/)
> 10. Concerning this salvation, the prophets, who spoke of the grace that was to come to you, searched intently and with the greatest care,
> 11. trying to find out the time and circumstances to which the Spirit of Christ in them was pointing when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories that would follow.
> 12. It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you, when they spoke of the things that have now been told you by those who have preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. Even angels long to look into these things.

They understood that something was coming, but it was revealed that the prophesy was not for them. Angels long to know what it is like to receive Christ. We look forward to things in the future, like the prophesy, but in the day, the feeling is more intense.

Yes, Jesus is powerful, but the way he suffers is the same way it happens to us. He feels the same things. **Jesus understands our suffering.** He knelt to God asking for change.

> [!bible] [Luke 22:31-32 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/42/22/)
> 31. “Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift you as wheat.
> 32. But I have prayed for you, Simon, that your faith may not fail. And when you have turned back, strengthen your brothers.”

In the first garden, humans dispbeyed, but in the 'second garden', the garden of gathsemone, Jesus, a human, obeyed God.

When was salvation a sure thing?
Genesis

> [!bible] [Genesis 3:15 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/1/3/)
> 15. And I will put enmity<br/>between you and the woman,<br/>and between your offspring and hers;<br/>he will crush your head,<br/>and you will strike his heel.”
