## Son of Man
Humans were created to:
- Glorify him
- Keep the garden
- Enjoying him
> God's design was perfect and we changed it

There's a balence between 'we're sinners' and "we were created in God's image"

> [!bible] [Daniel 7:13-14 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/27/7/)
> 13. â€œIn my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.
> 14. He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.

Jesus was the favourite user of 'the Son of Man' because it ties him to the prophesy. It identifies with his humanity. 

> [!bible] [Mark 8:31 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/41/8/)
> 31. Jesus Predicts His Death<br/>He then began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders, chief priests and teachers of the law, and that he must be killed and after three days rise again.

### The Kingdom of God
It started with being born from Mary. 
As a human, he:
- Wept
- Taught at a young age
- Temptation in the desert
- Baptism
- He preached about it

Adam and Eve were punished for the same thing that Jesus was crucified for. Jesus had to come and redeem us for that. 

The last step of the process is when he comes back and the day of reckoning. 

When Jesus comes back everyone will know him. Every knee will bow and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is lord.
