Name of names

One of the names of Jesus is that he is the great high priest.

### Jesus as a King

> [!bible] [John 12:9-11 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/43/12/)
> 9. Meanwhile a large crowd of Jews found out that Jesus was there and came, not only because of him but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
> 10. So the chief priests made plans to kill Lazarus as well,
> 11. for on account of him many of the Jews were going over to Jesus and putting their faith in him.

> [!bible] [John 12:12-19 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/43/12/)
> 12. The Triumphal Entry<br/>The next day the great crowd that had come for the Feast heard that Jesus was on his way to Jerusalem.
> 13. They took palm branches and went out to meet him, shouting,<br/>“Hosanna!”<br/>“Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord!”<br/>“Blessed is the King of Israel!”
> 14. Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written,
> 15. “Do not be afraid, O Daughter of Zion;<br/>see, your king is coming,<br/>seated on a donkey’s colt.”
> 16. At first his disciples did not understand all this. Only after Jesus was glorified did they realize that these things had been written about him and that they had done these things to him.
> 17. Now the crowd that was with him when he called Lazarus from the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to spread the word.
> 18. Many people, because they had heard that he had given this miraculous sign, went out to meet him.
> 19. So the Pharisees said to one another, “See, this is getting us nowhere. Look how the whole world has gone after him!”

Jesus is bringing in to free the people from the slavery of sin, as God saved the Israelites from the Egyptians.
The miracles including Lazarus confirm that Jesus is the Messiah.
The people of the time saw Jesus for who he is, but others ignored him.

Jesus isKing over:
**Salvation**

> [!bible] [Colossians 2:13-15 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/51/2/)
> 13. When you were dead in your sins and in the uncircumcision of your sinful nature, God made you alive with Christ. He forgave us all our sins,
> 14. having canceled the written code, with its regulations, that was against us and that stood opposed to us; he took it away, nailing it to the cross.
> 15. And having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross.

Jesus *cancelled* our debt to sin. We don't need to worry about our past sins as they are all gone. Satan can't use them against us anymore.

> [!bible] [John 11:25 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/43/11/)
> 25. Jesus said to her, “I am the resurrection and the life. He who believes in me will live, even though he dies;

> [!bible] [1 Corinthians 15:19-25 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/46/15/)
> 19. If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are to be pitied more than all men.
> 20. But Christ has indeed been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
> 21. For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead comes also through a man.
> 22. For as in Adam all die, so in Christ all will be made alive.
> 23. But each in his own turn: Christ, the firstfruits; then, when he comes, those who belong to him.
> 24. Then the end will come, when he hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power.
> 25. For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.

Jesus is gathering people into his kingdom of heaven. The first Adam brings death. The second Adam brings life in his perfect kingdom.

**Cosmos**

> [!bible] [Colossians 1:15-17 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/51/1/)
> 15. The Supremacy of Christ<br/>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
> 16. For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.
> 17. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

**Future**

The more time we spend time in God's word, the more we get our eyes opened.
The good, the bad, and the new and perfect.
