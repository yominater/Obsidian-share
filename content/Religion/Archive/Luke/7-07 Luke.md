> 56. Then they went home and prepared spices and perfumes. But they rested on the Sabbath in obedience to the commandment.

**Simon**
Simon came from Cyrene, a far away place. He was probably simply a passer-by, and he got caught up in someone else's mess

How did Simon feel when he had to carry Jesus' cross?
How will we feel when we put our load down and pick up our cross? 

**Women**
It wasn't wrong for the women to weep for Jesus. They know Him and empathized with Him. 

They were told to weep for their kids for the destruction later, and the judgement. For how the people are acting when Jesus is around, they will act worse when he's gone. 

**Crucifixion**
Jesus prays for the criminals because they actually probably don't know what they are doing. Similarly, we can't forget the people next door. 
> How often do we pray for our enemies even as they hurt us?

Imagine how Jesus felt when they were physically killing him but He still prayed for them. 

We need to be like the second criminal and not the first. We don't shouldn't focus on the physical pain, but on eternal salvation through Jesus. 

God calls us to get with other people not so we will change their mind but so he can. 

The centurian saw what happened and he was transformed. After the crucifixion, he saw this was significant and praised God. 

The people beating their chest mean they were experiencing grief or remorse. They had an 'uh oh' moment. The hours before they were making fun of Jesus, but now they saw and were grieving. 

**Attitudes**
> Where do we want to be? 

We need to be able to stand up for our cause.

> How can the cross become for significant in our life?
