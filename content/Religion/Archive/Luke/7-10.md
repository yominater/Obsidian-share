Yes Jesus did nothing wrong and died, but he had a choice so it was not an unwilling punishment. He had the power to die and revive or to not die. Jesus was God Himself taking the punishment on Himself. 

There had to be a death for our sins. Jesus dies for that. 

Forgiveness means the person receives the justice instead of requiring justice. In this case of we sin against God, and God instead of punishing us he punishes himself. 

Sinners in the hands of an angry God.
