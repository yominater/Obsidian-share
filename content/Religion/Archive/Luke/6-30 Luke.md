### Luke 23
Pharasies trying to kill Jesus. They can not though because the law. They need to find a way to prove he is a criminal. They also don't want to turn him to a martyr. They have tried to get him in trouble with Pilate before so he is on to them. He then asks the simple question that could condemn him. No guild was found so he passed the buck to the authority of the area where Jesus came from. Jesus knew Herod's heart and didn't give him a show; a display. 
He didn't defend himself because it was God's plan to let it happen. 
When Jesus came back, Pilate called in the people to try to get some opinions the same as him. The people though wanted a murderer instead of Jesus. He probably was against the Romans the same as the people.
