# Question 36
> [!QUESTION] What do we believe about the Holy Spirit?
> That he is God, coeternal with the Father and Son, and that God grants him irrevocably to all who believe
## The Holy Spirit
The Holy Spirit is a **person** and **God**
Being [God](../../Topics/What%20is%20God.md), he shares the same attributes of God.

The Holy Spirit is a person because;
- Can be grieved
- Has will
- Insulted
He has emotions and is not a vaugue force. The pronoun used is always 'he' in the Bible.  

Since he is a person, he can too be prayed to.
# Question 35
> [!QUESTION] Since we are redeemed by grace alone, through faith alone, where does this faith come from? 
> All the gifts we receive from Christ we receive through the Holy Spirit, including faith itself.

 The [](.md#The%20Holy%20Spirit|Holy%20Spirit)(gift) is able to be heard but not where it goe or where it comes from. [Faith](../../Topics/Faith.md) is a work of the Holy Spirit. It's a gift. 

We don't work for salvation. [8-24 Questions 34](8-24%20Questions%2034.md) 

It is a change of heart by the Holy Spirit towards repentance to God. One responds with reaction to the Holy Spirit. We din't have a choice to accept if the Spirit(God) is behind it.
