# Question 37
> [!QUESTION] How does the Holy Spirit help us?
> The Holy Spirit convicts us of our sin, comforts us, guides us, gives us spiritual gifts and he desire to obey God, and he enables us to pray and to understand God's word. 

> How can I distinguish between the persons?

They all have the same qualities, they simply work differently. *They act in different ways.* 
### What does the Holy Spirit do?
"We want to be biblical thinkers rather than speculative thinkers" - Sinclair

#### Pitfalls
**1. Assuming that the relationship between Christ and the Holy Spirit is normative to me and the Holy Spirit.** 
Christ is divine, I am not. Christ knows the Holy Spirit wholly. They are inseparable. 

Christ was also sinless in his humanity. The Holy Spirit never needs to correct Jesus. 

**2. Viewing particular works is the Holy Spirit as normative in the life of every believer.**
It's hard to define a miracle. Everything is a miracle. 

The Spirit can do miracles. It still won't be normative in our life. We won't all those from the Spirit. 

The Spirit can work in mysterious ways. 
#### Work overall
The Holy Spirit has a unique role in the trinity. 

God decrees, the Son accomplishes, the Spirit manifests. 
> [!bible] [Colossians 1:15-17 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/51/1/)
> 15. The Supremacy of Christ<br/>He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
> 16. For by him all things were created: things in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or powers or rulers or authorities; all things were created by him and for him.
> 17. He is before all things, and in him all things hold together.

The only defining feature between the persons in what they accomplish. What they do. 

Lamach named Noah to be the messiah, but he was not him. He thought world bad, and he wanted help. Noah built the ark which saved people from the wrath of God until a dove came. At Christ's baptism, a dove came to say Jesus is the 'second ark'. 

We should have our relationship with the Holy Spirit like our relationship with Jesus. 

#### Work in the believer

When Jesus would leave, he said he would gift the Spirit to the disciples to live *in* them, not simply with them. 

In this situation too, Good decrees, Christ accomplishes, and the Spirit manifests. 

Creation was to glorify us. The first creation was a temple. Everything was to be a place of worship for God. The world was good, it simply wasn't the garden. Christ is the Adam of a new creation to do what Adam did n not. Christ makes *us* temples. If we are to accomplish the mission, we need to be better temples. The Spirit does that work, aka sanctification. The spirit aligns our heart and mind to Christ. 
[Christ as the second adam](Christ%20as%20the%20second%20adam)

How would we be helped by the apostles? 
*Be reading the Bible*. The Spirit teaches us through the Bible. The Spirit lets us rightly read the Bible. 

If my personal revelation is in scripture, good. If not, it's not true.
