### Question 29
> [!BOOK]+ ###### How can we be saved?
> Only by faith in Jesus Christ in his substitutionary atoning death on the cross;

"...Godâ€¦imputes to us the perfect righteous of Christ when we repent and believe Him?" 
**What must I do to be saved, practically?**
It is important to get this right because if we don't get it right it will mean nothing. 
Use the Biblical vocabulary
--Mark 1:
Jesus tells us to recieve the Gospel, then *repent and believe*. 

##### What are wrong responses to the Bible?
**Nothing(Just believe)**
--James 2:14-19
[Works](../../Topics/Works.md) shows faith. Works do not mean that we will get a reward. 

**Come to church**
[Evangelism](../../Topics/Evangelism.md)
One may if unsure of themself, just say 'come to church'. They want to delegate to the church or [Pastor](../../Topics/Pastor.md). 
The right response should be to educate ourselves in the church so we can tell the person to repent and believe. This should include:
- A full lesson of the Gospel
- A call to repent and believe. 
It's not a bad thing to do, it should just not be the main point. 

An unbeliever should walk into a church and see christians doing christian things; and see God in them. 

**Oh nothing**
One doesn't need to do *anything* at all, not even believe. 

**Make a decision**
Instead of requiring a change of heart, require a decision. 'Decide to ask Jesus into your heart.' Instead, say 'repent and believe'. [7-28](7-28) 

##### Dangers of the wrong response

**Legalism**
Without the knowledge how to repent and believe, one works hard to achieve via works. 

**License**
'Do nothing'

**Presumption**
Presuming that they are fine because they raised their hand and grace grace grace grace. It only matters if Christ knows you, not the other way around. 

**Lack of assurance**
'I'm not sure if I'm really saved'
Rollercoaster of emotions. Commitment ==> faith ==> drought ==> despair =>^

---

Faith is the avenue by which we are saved, not what saves us. We are saved by **grace** through **faith**
