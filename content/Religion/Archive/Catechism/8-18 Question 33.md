# Question 33

[8-18(excalidraw)](../../Attachments/8-18(excalidraw).md)
**Justification** - declared righteous(free from the penalty of sin) ->
**Sanctification** - Being made actually righteous, little bits over time.(free from the power of sin)
**Glorification** - Righteous(free from the presence of sin)

Catholics believe that we work in justification while we don't. (legalism)
**Legalism** - when you follow rules over God's word in order to merit salvation.
\- Offering to God unacceptable worship, demanding its acceptance.

Once saved, there are 'oughts' and 'ought nots'. We don't *need* yo do these for salvation, but how could we? We get convicted to do those things so we should very do them.

Nadab and Abaidu offer incense not prescribed and they were consumed with fire.

Tries to stabilize the Ark and died. He didn't realize that his hand was no cleaner than the dirt.

## We Need to Reject Legalism, Why?
**1; It denies the necessity for a savior**. 'There are other ways to get my salvation'

**2. It denies the capability of Christ to save.**
some people say that Christ *and* us both work together to achieve justification.

We can't ever reach 100% for God ness. Therefore Christ always covers it.

**3. It denies God's wisdom in salvation.**
It makes man a bug deal.

If man is a big deal in theology: bad.
