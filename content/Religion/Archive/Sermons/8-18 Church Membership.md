**What is church membership?**

We need the church. We need fellowship with other people. 

Confusion starts with what a church is. 

**1. What is the church?** 
The church is not the building. Neither is it programs or ministries. 

--1 Peter 2:4-10

The church is a people. It is a better question to ask *who* the church is. They are a people defined by God's mercy. They are God's people. The church is universal and global. 

The local church is the physical, known manifestation of the universal church. They are two different perspectives of the church. 90/~114 church references the local church. 

**2. What is church membership?**
What is local church membership? 

If the church itself is not a building but a people, than church membership mist be how you relate to that people. 

Membership is a relationship of discipleship and accountability. The church offers guidance and the person accepts that. 

One christian is not a church by themself. They are not designed to be alone, they are designed to be together. 

Going to church doesn't make you a christian the same as standing in your garage doesn't make you a car. 


**3. Responding to church culture**
