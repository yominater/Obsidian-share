Instead of how we are taught to view the world *by* the world, how about something different?
### See the world as God intends
Let's change our view style of the world to something more Christian.
##### God created the world
He owns everything. He can control everything. We are powerless compared to him. **He controls everything in our life.**

##### We don't deserve anything but death
Adam and Eve sinned. They ignored God's one rule and left him. We are now scarred and have a [sinful](What%20is%20sin.md) nature. Our nature is to stray from God, to ignore his commands and to follow our heart. Because God is infinitely great, when we sin we are committing an infinite atrocity. Thankfully God is gracious so He sent Jesus to die for our sins. 

**We don't deserve life.** Anything God gives us is out of his sheer grace. We do not work to deserve it. If anything bad happens to us, God is keeping his wrath away still. 

It really makes you appreciate life more. Sounds like [quiddity](quiddity)

<u>Every physical thing here on earth points to God's glory.</u>
