### What is hell?
Hell is a place that is full of God's wrath for sin but absent of His [grace](Grace.md). It is where we are meant to go without God's grace. 

#### What happens in hell?
Sinners still rebel from God in hell.

There will be pain and suffering
> [!bible]+ [Matthew 13:49-50 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/13/)
> 49. This is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will come and separate the wicked from the righteous
> 50. and throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
