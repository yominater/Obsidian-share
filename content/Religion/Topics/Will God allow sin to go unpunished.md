**Idolatry**: trusting in created things for our happiness and security. 

## Q: Will God allow our transgressions to go unpunished?
### A: No, every sin is against the sovereignty and holiness of God and his law, and he will punish us in this life and the life to come. 

The [Laws](Laws.md) of God shows us our imperfection(again). It highlights our need for our savior. The law is a reflection of who God is. When we break it we insult God and we say we are better than God. 

**What happens when we do life our own way?** 
God with punish us for our insubordination. He **is** love but *since* he loves us he will punish us if we do not repent. 

All [sins](What%20is%20sin.md) are the same to God. Whichever law we break we are breaking our covenant with God so it's all the same. It's so easy for is to make simple 'small' sins. We need to be on alert for everything. Small sins have the capability to be much worse than big sins because they are much easier. Is God not so powerful that we would hold out to sin bigger? Do we demote him to smaller sins. 

When we sin, God's fixed response is his wrath. Included is [Hell](Hell.md)(the absence of God's grace)

We need salvation from God and his wrath, not hell(the jail cell).
