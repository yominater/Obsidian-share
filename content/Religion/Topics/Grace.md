Is there any way to escape punishment and be brought back into God's favor? 

Yes, through Jesus
Yes, to satisfy his justice, God reconciles us from sin and punishment of our sins through a redeemer.

We did not earn grace so we can't loose it. God gave is grace saving is from death. Grave is goodness we don't deserve. We can't earn it and we can never pay it back. "If it is of works it can no longer be of grace." 

How works work is works happen after we get motivated. We will WANT to work.

> But the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. 

Again we are only saved through grace.
