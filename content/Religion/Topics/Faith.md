### What is faith?
Belief without proof. Also *acting on belief*. 

### Faith in God
"God is too good to be unkind, and too wise to be mistaken. When we can't trace his hand, we must trace his heart." - Spurgeon

Faith is used a lot but misunderstood. 
Because of a heart of faith, we follow God. 

1. Faith that is pleasing to God always begins with a right understanding. The right understanding begins with understanding we are sinful. 
2. Understanding leads to conviction
3. Conviction becomes commitment

It's scary to be vulnerable, to have faith in something. Humans don't like being vulnerable. We like being in control of our life. This reminds me of how humans like things being stable, as in [](Maslow's%20hierarchy%20of%20needs#^fcb2b1)


Faith is a conscious choice. It understands that we have rejected God. We need to say to God that we need help. 
"Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things unseen.

Both Abel and Enoch had faith that led them to a decision. This faith pleases God. 

It is impossible for us to please God without faith.
