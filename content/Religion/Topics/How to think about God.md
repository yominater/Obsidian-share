Think of God always, in everything, since God is in everything, all around us. 

We should live for the rest of our time here on Earth not consumed by human passions but spend with God. Keep eternity in the forefront of our minds. Balance investment and spending time. There are 2 ways we can spend our time, spend time or invest time. 
Invest: Not loosing it, but growing it. 

Jesus could come back any day, any hour. 

Make the rest of our time count:
1. Invest in God's will. 
2. Invest in evangelism

**If you wait, it's too late**
