## Calibrating our expectations
Calibrating: setting to an objective standard. 
Expectations of pastors. 
The perfect pastor is perfect but impossible. (no one is perfect) 
Compromise is not calibration. We arn't supposed to line up expectations from each other, but instead the standard should be the Word of God. 
##### Terms for office:
Elder, Overseer, Pastor

1. Elder. Greek work Presbyteros. Used most often in the new testament as the term of office. Elders lead or rule in the church.  
2. Overseer. Oversees ministries and business of the church. Make sure things done to God's direction. Don't micromanage. 
3. Pastor. Authority is not unlimited in the Bible. Pastors check the power of the overseer and the elder. Pastors shepard the flock of God. The church belongs to God. He is the Chief shepard. Pastors don't pastor from pedestals. A pastor **tends** to the flock. 
    1. Feed His sheep
