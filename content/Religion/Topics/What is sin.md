### What is sin?
Sin is any want of conformity unto, or transgression of any law of God, given as a rule to the reasonable creature. 

Sin is rejecting God, disobeying his law which destroys us. 
> [!book]- ### What is sin?
> Sin is rejecting or ignoring God in the world he created, rebelling against Him without reference to Him, not being or doing what he requires in the law - resulting in our death and the disintegration of all creation. 
> \- New City Catechism
#### What does it do to us?
It changes the way we see and understand the Gospel and engage with culture. 
It also:
- Make us think sinning isn't bad
- Makes us think God isn't good
- Makes us see the world through sin-colored glasses
### How does God deal with sin?
God's punishment is death to sin.
> [!bible]+ [Romans 6:23 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/45/6/)
> 23. For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.



Things are bad depending on how valuable the thing we act against is. Since Gods is infinitely valuable, sins are infinitely bad. 

**Thoughts**
> Am I really rejecting or ignoring God? 
Rebelling him without reference to him. 


> [!bible] [2 Corinthians 5:21 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/47/5/)
> 21. God made him who had no sin to be sin for us, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

Jesus was without sin which is amazing. 
We however cannot live without sin. We are always in sin. When we become a Christian, we are not any sinless, but we are legally, officially declared as righteous. Jesus took on God's entire wrath. He is infinite value so he could pay our sins.
