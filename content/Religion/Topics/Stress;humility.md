**1 Peter 5:5b-7**
"...All of you, clothe yourselves with humility toward one another, because, 'God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.' Humble yourselves, therefore, under God's mighty hand, that he may lift you up in due time. Cast **all** your anxiety on him because he cares for you."

**Matthew 23:12**
For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.

**Anxiety:** cares divided and broken into pieces. 

**Mom anxiety** a unique anxiety relating to raising children. 

One place to go for support is small groups(Christian) but go to God first. 

#### Why do we feel anxious?
We feel anxious because of our **lack of humility**, of our **pridefulness**
We feel like a human is supposed to 'hold it all together' and control everything around them. 
We feel anxious *when we try to regain control that we thought we lost or are losing or never had.* 

**Pride** says that "we can hold it all together." "I can do it all"; "If I don't do it, it won't be done(well)". Pride keeps us from going to others, from going to God for help. 

We are so prideful we think that God should have consulted us before he made decisions for our life. We need to understand that *we are not God*. We do not get to define our own reality. Once understand that, we can get released from anxiety. Once that, we can clothe ourselves from humility, just as we clothe with clothes. "...but gives grace to the humble." When we are humble, God will pour out his grace to us. 

If we are prideful, we are inviting God's opposition. If we have turmoil in our life, it could be God opposing us for our pridefulness. 

### How do we clothe in humility?
*It all starts with a right view of God.* 
A right view of God leads to a right view of ourselves. 
Two truths:
1. God is strong(so he **can** handle it)
2. God cares(so he **wants** to handle it)

*God's might hand is at work in every aspect in my life.* This includes the anxiety too. We need to stop and let God drive it out. We need to stop resisting the hand of God in our life. **Want to tell myself every morning: God is sovereign over my life**

The first step is recognizing God's power. Then recognize he cares. 
**God's might is matched by his goodness.**

This is not about learning to manage my anxieties. This is about shifting my anxieties to God. 
He wants this *because he cares for me.* 
We need to give him everything, even our little cares. 
God is not mad at us because we cannot care for ourself. God isn't frustrated because we put too much on him. God *wants* to take our cares, our anxieties from us and put them back together. 
He will receive it when we turn from our pride and become humble. Until then, we will not loose our anxiety.
