# What is human
A human is a creature **made in God's image** designed to be with Him forever and glorify Him. 

#### The end of humans
[The end of humans](The%20end%20of%20humans.md)

### The flesh
Because Adam and Eve sinned, we are infected with [sin](What%20is%20sin.md). Humans are not inherently sinful, but sin makes us so. The [devil](What%20is%20the%20devil.md) and his men try to keep us out of the fight with God. They try to make us stagnate, question our beliefs, think 'it'll be fine if I tell this one white lie'

While it tells us it is for us to be happy.  
There is a daily battle between my want and God's will. We need to take the time to focus on doing God's will and not listening to the flesh. 

### Living in the world
Eventually we will loose everything here on earth. We need to make our time count by focusing on God. God will not go away ever. We have no other boast than Jesus. 
> [!bible]+ [Philippians 3:7-8 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/50/3/)
> 7. But whatever was to my profit I now consider loss for the sake of Christ.
> 8. What is more, I consider everything a loss compared to the surpassing greatness of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord, for whose sake I have lost all things. I consider them rubbish, that I may gain Christ

We should forgive others' sins as God forgave ours. 
To accomplish this, we need a new heart. 
### Limitations
Humans are finite beings. we should assume we never understand everything. Some things are just way too complex for us like how God has always existed and the Trinity. We will never know anything and we never CAN know everything. 

We sense things through imperfect sensors. The world we see is not the true world. We hear what we want to hear. We think what we want to think

### Christian
God is always in us, as are we with God. We have to be with him to bear fruit. 
As we follow and glorify him, he will grant our wishes as they align with his will. 
To accomplish this, we do not need to try harder. We need a new heart. 

Through [Sanctification](Sanctification.md) God will align our thoughts and will.
