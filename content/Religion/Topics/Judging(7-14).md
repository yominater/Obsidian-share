Judge here is used in different places with different meanings.

**3. God judging us.**
Condemnation to eternal punishment. In this case we are free. We are therefore not to judge other people in this case. We don't have the authority.

**2.Judge meaning showing** favoritism to people with power and against poor or social status. This is judging how humans see people.

**1.Holding other believers accountable for their sins**
Christians are not supposed to hold non-believers for their sins.

We hold each other responsible. Not directly, as it's not our fault for sins, but in the prophetic sense. We can offer help but we are not responsible for how others receive the word. We are all allies in the fight against sin.

The issue is we don't like to call out sins to their face. We should callout in love and trying to help them.

##### How Do I Judge People Correctly?
Have a heart of judgemental: arrogance, lacks love and mercy, it's not about helping, it's about making me better

How to not be judgemental.

Before we judge:
###### 1. Am I being hyper-critical? 
<mark class="yellow">(the golden rule)</mark>
Ask yourself. Am I trying to build up or tear down?
**How hypercritical comes out**
1. "Gives judgement when the matter is of no concern to them"
2. "Puts personalities in the place of principle"
3. "Expresses their opinion without knowledge of all the facts"
4. "A hypercritical person never takes the trouble to understand the circumstances, and is never ready to excuse; it is never ready to extend mercy."

###### \2. Am I being hypocritical? 
> [!bible] [Matthew 7:4-5 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/7/)
> 4. How can you say to your brother, ‘Let me take the speck out of your eye,’ when all the time there is a plank in your own eye?
> 5. You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.

Hypocritical comes from a judgemental heart. 
> Am I hypocritical in the way I judge? Do I do the same things or worse? 

**How hypocrisy comes out in judgement**
1. We do because we ignore the log. 
2. We think we're better than other people. 

###### 3. Am I being clear-sighted? 
> [!bible] [Matthew 7:5 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/40/7/)
> 5. You hypocrite, first take the plank out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother’s eye.


Jesus does not say to the hypocrite: mind your own business. The point is fix yourself first, then others. When we fail to call out sin in others, we are stunting their growth. 

**Main point**
You have to be clear sighted enough to help. 

**The place to start**
*Your own eye.*
> What log do I have in my own eye?
