#### Gifts
Be sure of your gift. You are a Christian, you have a gift even if you don't know it, a unique gift. Each gift was given to God to serve others. 'Tis a grace gift from the Holy Spirit when one becomes a christian. __Be sure of your gift__. The best way to discover your gifts is to get in and start serving. Also steward your gift. Stewardship means managing something that is someone else's property.  "As each has received a gift, use it."(1 Peter 3:10) Discovering a gift without using is a bad thing. Challenge to those is to wear that gift. The gift was given TO us FOR the church. When you use your gift, you make the holy spirit visible to other people. We will answer to God for how we hive our gifts. 

**Spiritual Gift:** Any ability that is empowered by the Holy Spirit and used in any ministry of the Church.
