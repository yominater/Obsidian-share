**God created us for his glory.** 

> [!bible]+ [Isaiah 43:6-7 - NKJV](https://bolls.life/NKJV/23/43/)
> 6. I will say to the north, ‘Give them up!’ And to the south, ‘Do not keep them back!’ Bring My sons from afar, And My daughters from the ends of the earth—
> 7. Everyone who is called by My name, Whom I have created for My glory; I have formed him, yes, I have made him.”

**Life is wasted when we do not live for the glory of God.** 
> [!bible]+ [1 Corinthians 10:31 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/46/10/)
> 31. So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.

### What is 'glorifying'?
It is like using a telescope on distant galaxies. We don't *make* them bigger, we just make them *appear* how they really are. It is the same with God. We don't increase his glory(how could we) but instead we *magnify* Him. We should show an image of how he really is to the World. 

### How do we glorify God?
We glorify God by:
- Enjoying Him
	- Enjoying the beauty in his Creation
- Loving Him
> What does this mean?
- Trusting Him
- Obeying his will
- serving the community
>works?
- Obeying his [Laws](Laws.md)
- Obeying his laws
- Using our [gifts](Everyone%20has%20a%20gift.md).
- Bearing much fruit. 
	We know if we are bearing fruit by looking at our actions and comparing to the Bible.
