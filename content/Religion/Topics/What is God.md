# The Trinity
In the trinity, the three *persons* of God share the same attributes of the *God* nature. What differs is how they work out of those attributes. 
## God
God is a Spirit, in and of himself infinite in being, glory, blessedness, and perfection; all-sufficient, eternal, unchangeable, incomprehensible, everywhere present, almighty, knowing all things, most wise, most holy, most just, most merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth.

God is the creator, the trinity. 
### Aspects of God
- God is holier than we can imagine He is. This makes our sins worse than we think. 
- God is just. That means he has to punish sin. He is full of wrath towards sin
- God is grace. He is full of grace and compassion
- God is all-powerful, all-knowing, everywhere at once.
- God is jealous for us. He doesn't want us to worship other "gods" [](Laws.md#^f175ad|The%20first%20commandment)
	- His jealousy helps us because we would be worse off if we turned to other gods for help
	- God is jealous for us. If we are friends with the world then we are enemies with God. 
## Jesus
God's own son sent to die on the cross in our place. 
He has been in heaven since the world's creation with God. He has interacted with humans times before coming down to earth. 

Jesus has two natures. His divine nature and his human nature. He has to have both to save our sins. 
## Holy Spirit
A 'spirit' sent by God to live in each of us and help [sanctify](Sanctification.md) us
