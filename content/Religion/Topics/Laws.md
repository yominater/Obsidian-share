### What are laws for?
We have laws to 
- show us how broken we are
- show our need for a savior
- to live a life worthy of the glory of God
- Show God's holiness/character
- Show us God's standard
- Guide us to live a worthy life
### What are laws?
Laws are made by God and impossible to achieve. We constantly break them in word, thought, and deed. 
Yes God forgives all are sins, but we still need to try and keep his laws because our loving relationship is like a marrige. We want to keep the other happy. We show we love the other. 
**if we don't follow these we don't get into heaven if we so so much? Does it depend on how we believe in Jesus?"
## The commandments

#### Thou shalt have no other Gods before me^f175ad
> [!note]- ###### Senselessness
> of seeking refuge with anything but God. 
Creating/worshiping idols is just about insane because the person is blind and their minds are closed **because of sin**. They are doing things that seem rational to them but in reality is insane. 
Idols don't have to be physical objects. They can also be when we want things too much from something, like wanting fame and etc from life. Ex: We worship the alter of our spreadsheet if we want to plan everything *thinking* it will make us perfect. 
Every single thing that humans turn to besides God is senseless. God fires back against this by making clear he is God(below)

God is our only god. 

#### Thou shalt not make unto thy any graven image
Have no idols

#### Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain;
for the Lord will not hold him guiltless that taketh His name in vain. 

#### Remember the sabbath day to be holy

#### Honor your father and mother
That your days will be long in the land the Lord your God giveth thee.

#### Thou shalt not covet
Not only just not coveting but being content with what you have and not resenting what God gave you or them. When we break this law we question God's wisdom; that he isn't good enough. We should be humble and be content with what we have. 

Post on social media only what won't be a stumbling block for others. Kinda the opposite of Professionalism in social media.
