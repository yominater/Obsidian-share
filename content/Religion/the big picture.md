# The Big Picture
## The Past
What came before
### Creation
All powerful God created everything, most greatly humans 'in the image of God' We are like statues, pointing to God. Our purpose is to [glorify God](Topics/Glorify%20God.md) in everything we do, point [point others to him](Topics/Evangelism.md), and [rejoice in him](rejoice%20in%20him). 

The first covenant(testament) was we would keep His law and we will live, or else die. We obviously failed since we are imperfect. Then God, through His [grace](Topics/Grace.md), created a way for us to live forever with Him. [](.md#^b49fcf|Redemption)
### The Fall
[the Fall](the%20Fall)
The first covenant(testament) was we would keep His law and we will live, or else die. We obviously failed since we are imperfect. Then God, through His [grace](Topics/Grace.md), created a way for us to live forever with Him. [](.md#^b49fcf|Redemption)

We broke the covenant and died spiritually. We now all are born with a sinful nature. 
God is righteous and MUST punish sin. That would make him just. 
### Redemption
^b49fcf

Christ died for our [sins](Topics/What%20is%20sin.md). This is the only way we could be saved from [Hell](Topics/Hell.md).
He died to humble Himself. The only way he can die is to become human. He became sympathetic towards us. He knows exactly how we feel. 

**It was necessary for God to be truly human to destroy sin.** It was also necessary for Jesus to be truly God, because of his divine nature his obedience and suffering would be perfect and effective; and also that would be able to bear the righteous anger of God against sin and yet overcome death. 

He relates experientially. God knows the pain in sin. He stands as a judge and sacrifice pointing to the cross. 

> [!bible]+ [1 John 1:9 - NIV](https://bolls.life/NIV/62/1/)
> 9. If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just and will forgive us our sins and purify us from all unrighteousness.

By dying, he thusly forgave all ours sins. They are forgotten.  He forgives us and forgets that we ever sinned. In Christ, we are sinless in the eyes of God. He makes us new. 
## The present and future
### Sanctification
![Sanctification](Topics/Sanctification.md)
This change is forwarded by the [](Topics/What%20is%20God.md#Holy%20Spirit|Holy%20Spirit). To get a very good idea of what we should do, we should read [the Bible](Topics/What%20is%20the%20Bible.md). 
### Consummation
Truly Man
- Fulfillment of Humanity's original design
	- Christ redeems our relationship with Him because he became man. 
Psalm 8
- Bring many sons with him
	- Christ had to become like us. He had to identify with us. 
Sin is not aain thing for humans. Sin is like a virus to our body. It is foreign to our body. 
The law shows us right and wrong. It's a corrective lens. 
Christ is more human than the rest of us. 

The virgin birth points to the invisible miracle of the sinless nature of God.
