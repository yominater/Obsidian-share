## Intro to how this website works
This is a linkâ†’ [Info](Info.md) If you click it it will take you to a page on this site. Internal links inside of the DWYL file don't work properly.

Topics are subdivided into headings. Headings are rainbow colored starting from red and ending at purple.

Bold items are importing things.

Callouts mark Bible verses or quotes. They are named as such. Bible callouts will have links linking pages to the verses on Bolls.
