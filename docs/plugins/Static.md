This plugin emits all static resources needed by Quartz. This is used, for example, for fonts and images that need a stable position, such as banners and icons. The plugin respects the `ignorePatterns` in the global [configuration](../configuration.md).

> [!important]
> This is different from [Assets](Assets.md). The resources from the [Static](.md) plugin are located under `quartz/static`, whereas [Assets](Assets.md) renders all static resources under `content` and is used for images, videos, audio, etc. that are directly referenced by your markdown content.

> [!note]
> For information on how to add, remove or configure plugins, see the [](../configuration.md#Plugins|Configuration) page.

This plugin has no configuration options.
