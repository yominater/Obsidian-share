title: Welcome to Quartz 4
---

Quartz is a fast, batteries-included static-site generator that transforms Markdown content into fully functional websites. Thousands of students, developers, and teachers are [already using Quartz](showcase.md) to publish personal notes, websites, and [digital gardens](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/networked-thought) to the web.

## ðŸª´ Get Started

Quartz requires **at least [Node](https://nodejs.org/) v20** and `npm` v9.3.1 to function correctly. Ensure you have this installed on your machine before continuing.

Then, in your terminal of choice, enter the following commands line by line:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz.git
cd quartz
npm i
npx quartz create
```

This will guide you through initializing your Quartz with content. Once you've done so, see how to:

1. [Writing content](authoring%20content.md) in Quartz
2. [Configure](configuration.md) Quartz's behaviour
3. Change Quartz's [layout](layout.md)
4. [Build and preview](../node_modules/mathjax-full/components/bin/build) Quartz
5. Sync your changes with [GitHub](setting%20up%20your%20GitHub%20repository.md)
6. [Host](hosting.md) Quartz online
